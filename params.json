{"name":"Sparkle Turntable Bot","body":"### Turntable.fm Bot\r\nSparkle Turntable Bot is the most popular free room bot on [Turntable.fm](http://www.turntable.fm). This bot is written in Node.JS and uses an optional MySQL server for room statistics. This project is developed and maintained by @sharedferret.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThis bot can:\r\n\r\n* Manage a waitlist/queue for a room\r\n* Enforce room rules regarding song limits and timeouts before a person can DJ again\r\n* Respond to a set of commands in chat and through TT.FM's new PM system\r\n* Report song stats after each song\r\n* Welcome users to the room via chat and PM\r\n* Receive and respond to commands via HTTP requests\r\n* Log events to the console and/or a MySQL database\r\n\r\n### See it in action\r\n\r\n* xxMEOWxx in [Indie/Classic Alternative 1 and Done](http://turntable.fm/indieclassic_alternative_1_done)\r\n* SearsTower in [Windy City Indie](http://turntable.fm/windy_city_indie2)\r\n\r\nSee a full list [on the Wiki](https://github.com/sharedferret/Sparkle-Turntable-Bot/wiki/Running-Bots).\r\n\r\n### Get your own\r\n[This guide](https://github.com/sharedferret/Sparkle-Turntable-Bot/wiki/Get-Started) will help you set up a copy of the bot in your Turntable.fm room. While it should be relatively straightforward, it does assume that you have a basic understanding of using a shell or command line. Since Sparkle Turntable Bot is designed to run 24 hours a day, installation on a server is optimal, but the bot will run fine on a personal computer.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nThanks to @alaingilbert for creating [TTAPI](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API/), the starting point for Sparkle Turntable Bot.
